The device is designed for packaging into Gainta G706 enclosure:
http://www.gainta.com/en/g706.html

The face panel can be made as PCB in the same order with the main board. In this case, use u-slon-face.kicad\_pcb.
Or it can be made with laser engraving; in this case, use u-slon-face-final.dxf.

The board is fixed at the panel, so you can use other enclosure just using the proper face panel.
